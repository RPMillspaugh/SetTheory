# SetTheory
Elementary Set Theory OER text

The file SetTh.tex is designed to be processed with either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. If you prefer to use pdfLaTeX, you should comment out the indicated lines in the header of the file. Only one of the lines in the Colorlink section of the header should be active. The current choice is for red hyperlinks, which are easy to see, but can make the Table of Contents hard on the eyes. I have included options for blue hyperlinks or black hyperlinks. Other color choices are available if you prefer another option.
